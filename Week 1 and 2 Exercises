//Hi Dan, I am not quite able to tackle the week 3 exercises yet as I still need to re-study those and work on my project, 
//but I thought I would still hand in some of what I could do for week 1 and 2 as you said that it's better to submit at least some of the work.

//Arrays Exercise 1: Breakfast 
const breakfast = [
    "eggs", 
    "bacon",

    "beans",
]

console.log(breakfast.length)

console.log(tooManyRabbits)

//String Exercise 1: Log Your Counrty

console.log(myCountry)

const favouriteFood = "okra soup" 
let result = favouriteFood.toUpperCase();
console.log(result)

    console.log("Hello World")
}
greeting()
